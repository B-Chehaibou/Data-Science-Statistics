# Practical Statistics for Data Scientists - Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that correspond to each chapter of the book **"Practical Statistics for Data Scientists"**. 
In these notebooks, I explain the different statistical concepts presented in the book and apply them using Python to a dataset from Kaggle on stroke prediction.

## Dataset Description


This dataset aims to predict the probability of a patient experiencing a stroke based on input parameters such as gender, age, pre-existing health conditions, and smoking status.t.

The dataset can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset
