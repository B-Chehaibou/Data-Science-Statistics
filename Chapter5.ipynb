    "### Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive bayes is a set of supervised learning algorithm based on the bayes'theorem. The latter gives the probability $P$ that an event $y$ occurs knowing that the events $x_1,x_2,$ and $x_3$ occured:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(y|x_1,x_2,x_3) = \\frac{P(y)P(x_1,x_2,x_3|y)}{P(x_1,x_2,x_3)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(y|x_1,x_2,x_3)$ : Probability that $y$ will occur knowing $x_1,x_2,$ and $x_3$ occured <br>\n",
    "$P(x_1,x_2,x_3|y)$ : Probability that $x_1,x_2,x_3$ will occur knowing $y$ occured <br>\n",
    "$P(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ : Probability that $x_1,x_2,x_3$ will occur <br>\n",
    "$P(y)$ : Probability that $y$ will occur <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can already see that in a classification context this is already very useful. For example, based on the content of an email (occurence of some words: dear,friend, money) we could compute the probability of being a spam or a normal mail. Thus, we will classify a mail (dear=1,friend=0, money=5) depending on which class (spam or normal) presents the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The naive term comes form the fact that we consider the features as independents. Taking the previous example, we assume that the presence \"dear\", \"friend\", and \"money\" in the mail is independent. This allows the following simplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(x_1,x_2,x_3|y) = P(x_1|y) P(x_2|y) P(x_3|y)$ <br>\n",
    "$P(x_1,x_2,x_3) = P(x_1) P(x_2) P(x_3)$ <br> <br>\n",
    "which makes the calculation easier. Indeed, the $P(x_1|y)$ can be obtained as the number of occurence $x_1$ knowing $y$ appearing in the training set, and $P(x_1)$ is the number of occurence of $x_1$. For example, P(dear|spam) is the number of \"dear\" appearing in spam emails in our training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the way I described so far the calculation of $P(x_1|y)$ can be only applied to count. But it exits different naive Bayes classifiers that differs mainly according to the form of $P(x_1|y)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multinomial Naive Bayes\n",
    "    * Good for counting features (e.g., how often a word appears in a document).\n",
    "* Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "    * Used for features with a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "* Bernoulli Naive Bayes\n",
    "    * Designed for binary/boolean features.\n",
    "* Complement Naive Bayes\n",
    "    * Suited for imbalanced data sets, and is a variation of MultinomialNB.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an overview of various applications along with the specific Naive Bayes methods best suited for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Text Classification\n",
    "    * Multinomial Naive Bayes: Optimal for handling the frequency counts of words or features in text documents.\n",
    "    * Complement Naive Bayes: Particularly effective for imbalanced data sets, often found in real-world text classifications.\n",
    "* Medical Diagnostics\n",
    "    * Gaussian Naive Bayes: Used when predicting diseases from continuous data like blood test results, where feature values are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "* Real Estate Pricing\n",
    "    * Gaussian Naive Bayes: Applicable when modeling prices based on features with normal distributions, such as size or age of the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assumption of features independence\n",
    "    * This assumption rarely holds in real-world data, where features often influence each other. \n",
    "* Zero-frequency problem\n",
    "    * In a record ($x_1,x_2,x_3$) when there is no occurence in the training set of a feature value (e.g. $x_1$) corresponding to class label ($y$), $P(x_1|y)$ will be zero so as $P(y|x_1,x_2,x_3)$. This can degrade the naive bayes performance and its robustness. One way to mitigate it is by using Laplace smoothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, I will develop and evaluate a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier that predicts whether individuals are likely to experience a stroke. I will start with a very simple model taking into account only the body mass index (BMI)."

    "Using only one feature, I obtained 94.5% of accuracy. This high accuracy is actually not a witness of the model performance but is due to the imbalanced target variable, where only 5.5% of the test set actually represents stroke cases. Indeed, a naive model that predicts 'non-stroke' for all cases will present the same accuracy score of 94.5%. For conditions like stroke, missing a positive case can have severe consequences. Therefore, relying on accuracy as a standalone metric in such scenarios is not only ineffective but potentially dangerous.

    "Classifications are generally based on the probability that a record belongs to one category or another. By default, many classifiers use a threshold of 50% to make this determination.

For instance, setting a threshold of 80% means a record is classified as label 1 only if the probability of it belonging to label 1 is greater than 80%; otherwise, it is classified as label 0. Adjusting the threshold in this manner typically decreases the false positives but increases the false negatives (misclassifying label 1 as label 0), consequently enhancing precision at the expense of recall.

However, this improvement lower the specificity, which decreased to 0.73, reflecting a minor increase in the rate of false positives, i.e., non-stroke cases incorrectly classified as strokes. This trade-off between recall and specificity is significant in medical applications, where the cost of missing a true positive (a stroke case) can be very high, potentially leading to severe health consequences. \n"

    "### Strategies for Imbalanced Data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In many real-world classification tasks, we often encounter datasets with imbalanced target data, where one class is more prevalent than the other. This scenario is common in medical diagnostics for predicting diseases within a population or in detecting fraud. In these cases, the less common class is usually of greater importance and typically labeled as 1. The misclassification of these critical cases as 0s (negative) is more detrimental than falsely identifying non-cases (0s) as 1s (positive). Nonetheless, most predictive models are designed to maximize overall accuracy, which can lead to a bias towards the majority class. This occurs because a model might achieve high accuracy simply by predominantly predicting the more frequent class. Additionally, these models often do not generalize well to the minority class due to the limited number of examples available to learn from.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Strategies\n",
    "* **Undersampling** : This technique involves reducing the number of examples from the majority class to balance the class distribution. The goal is to decrease the size of the larger class by randomly eliminating records.\n",
    "    * Pros: Helps balance the datased.\n",
    "    * Cons: Potential loss of valuable data that could be important for model training.\n",
    "    * Use Case: Effective when the dataset is sufficiently large, and the risk of losing information is minimal.\n",
    "* **Oversampling and Up/Down Weighting** : It involves replicating data points from the minority class to equalize the class proportions (done by bootstrapping). Up/Down weighting adjusts the weights of the data based on their frequency.\n",
    "    * Pros: Helps in learning rare events without losing valuable data.\n",
    "    * Cons: Can lead to overfitting due to the repetition of minority class samples.\n",
    "    * Use Case: Useful when the dataset size is small.\n",
    "* **Data Generation** : Synthetic data generation techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or ADASYN are used to create artificial samples based on the existing minority class samples.\n",
    "    * Pros: Enhances the training process by introducing variability in the minority class.\n",
    "    * Cons: Synthetic samples may not perfectly represent real-world scenarios. Need numerical data.\n",
    "    * Use Case: Ideal when more samples are needed, and the minority class is too small to provide sufficient information on its own.\n",
    "* **Cost-Based Classification** : This approach modifies the learning algorithm so that it assigns a higher cost to misclassifying the minority class. Essentially, the model is penalized more for misclassifying a minority class than a majority class.\n",
    "    * Pros: Directly focuses on reducing the type of errors that are more consequential to the problem.\n",
    "    * Cons: Requires careful tuning to avoid biasing the model excessively towards the minority class.\n",
    "    * Use Case: Best suited for situations where the costs of misclassification are high, such as in fraud detection or medical diagnosis.\n",

    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, I will apply the different strategies to the studied dataset. For that I will construct a function that takes as arguments: the dataframe, the classifier (e.g. GaussianNB()), and the strategy of imbalanced data (e.g. SMOTE). Here the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preprocessing Setup:\n",
    "    * Identifies and processes categorical features using OneHotEncoder and continuous features using StandardScaler.\n",
    "2. Resampling Configuration:\n",
    "    * Depending on the chosen strategy (smote, undersample, or oversample), the appropriate resampling technique is applied to address class imbalance.\n",
    "3. Pipeline Construction:\n",
    "    * An ImbPipeline is constructed which combines preprocessing, resampling, and the classifier to ensure correct workflow and prevent data leakage.\n",
    "4. Data Splitting and Model Training:\n",
    "    * The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained using the training data.\n",
    "5. Model Evaluation:\n",
    "    * Performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix and metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and specificity, providing insights into the classifier’s effectiveness."

    "Logistic regression is a statistical modeling technique used to predict the probability of a binary outcome. It estimates the probability that an outcome falls into a specific category based on input variables.\n",

    "It relied on the logistic function or sigmoid function, defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where z is a linear combination of input features, $z = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\ldots + \\beta_n x_n$.\n",
    "The sigmoid function maps any real values into the (0, 1) interval, making it a perfect tool for modeling probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In logistic regression, we model the log odds (logit) of the probability $p$ of the dependent variable being 1. The logit is expressed as the linear combination of the predictors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$log(\\frac{p}{1-p}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\ldots + \\beta_n x_n$\n",
    "\n",
    "The key property of logistic regression is that it links the log odds directly to the linear combination of the input variables, implying that changes in the predictors have a multiplicative effect on the odds of the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the coefficient $\\beta_i$ for each predictor variable $x_i$ tells us the change in the log odds when $x_i$ is increased of one unit, holding all other predictors constant. In other words, a positive coefficient $\\beta_i$ tells us that its corresponding predictor $x_i$ increases the odds of the dependent variable being 1. \n",
